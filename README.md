# slurm_script
This is job submitting script for slurm system. Most of the scripts are written specifically for metagenomic dataset including quality control, reads assembly, contig binning and downstream genomic analysis including functional annotation, taoxnomic classification, dereplication et.al. Note that all I use a conda based strategy for all softwares needed but not module load based. There are some advantages using conda. For example, you do not need to contact your system admin to install software for you and you also do not need to create your own module. Conda will solve all the problems for you. If some softwares can not be installed via conda, you can then add the executables of those software to the conda bin directory. For each software, please refer to its usage for each parameter. I am just offering parameters that are best for my dataset. Let me know when you have any questions
